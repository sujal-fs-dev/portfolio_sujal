        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>Hello! My name is Sujal Vyas, and I am currently pursuing a Bachelor of Information Technology with a major in Web Application Development and Web Development at Victoria University, Sydney Campus. As a second-year student, I am passionate about leveraging technology to create dynamic and responsive web applications that enhance user experiences.

            My journey in the world of technology began with a strong interest in coding and web development, which has only grown over the years. I have gained practical experience through my role as a Project Intern at Special Character Company in Ahmedabad, India. During my 6-month internship, I had the opportunity to work on real-world projects, where I applied my skills in HTML, CSS, Python, and SQL to develop and maintain web applications.
            
            In addition to my technical skills, I am committed to continuous learning and staying updated with the latest industry trends. This dedication ensures that I can bring innovative solutions to any project I undertake. My academic background, combined with hands-on experience, has equipped me with a solid foundation in both the theoretical and practical aspects of web development.
            
            I am enthusiastic about collaborating with professionals and organizations to contribute to impactful projects. Whether it's developing a new web application from scratch or optimizing an existing one, I am eager to apply my knowledge and skills to solve complex challenges and deliver high-quality results.
            
            Thank you for visiting my portfolio. I look forward to connecting with like-minded individuals and exploring opportunities to create exceptional web experiences together.</p>
